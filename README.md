#### Notice
This software is currently in early alpha state and so i want to warn - There is currently no ciritcal bug i know about but maybe still some potential for (Memcached) data loss - from my point of view its not critical in development cause it's a non-persistent memory store we're talkin about - but it's just fair to warn you before you use it! :)
